One Room
Similar in feel to agar.io - a bunch of players in a single room with a white background
Jump in and play for a while, then leave

You can place as many flags as you want at any time
Units are single points with a radius of your color with an arrow showing which direction it faces (make it a triangle)
"Rounds" last 5-10 seconds
After a round, the system takes each of your units, determines which cursor it is closest to and orients the unit towards that flag
The unit then moves a fixed amount of distance towards that flag
If there are any other players units overlapping any of your units, whichever has a better angle of attack wins

UI is just mouse clicks
Graphics could just be canvas and maybe webgl if i have time

User can click on a place in the map to place a flag of their color
User can click on a flag to remove it

If there is time, add simple terrain

Unts overlap with other players, but don't overlap with each other


x1*x2+y1*y2
Dot product between the attack vector and the vector between the centers

attack vector = unit.angle

unit1
unit2
